Starcraft 2 mechanics improvement tool

------------------
Installation

Setup / uninstall this tool as used to do: run "setup.exe" and after you're done with it just go to "control panel -> add /remove programms"

------------------
How to use it:

1. select a gamespeed and go into game
2. press 'ctrl-alt-m' or click "Start" button when game is started. Futher 'ctrl-alt-m' or 'Pause' will toggle pause mode

*** play ***

(at least few minutes otherwise you'll get score like "?/100")
3. press 'ctrl-alt-shift-m' / "Stop" button when game is end and check the score. Tool also will show you longest periods of "no-taping", "no watching on minimap", "no resources cheking" in game time format
4. Analyze!

------------------
How estimation goes:

a) taping:
right now tool watching only for 1,2,3 and w keys as building's keys (it's my keys when I'm playing a protoss). To add a key press 'shift-#' or 'ctrl-#' (it's natural but 'ctrl-w' so ... anyway). To remove key press 'alt-#' (it's when you no longer need this hotkey for some reason).
To get 100 score you should do full cycle of taping within 17 seconds (probe building time) for the first 10 minutes of the game, then this period increases - 30 sec (about a cooldown of warpgate) till game is done;
b) right clicks - sequental right clicks decrease your score (shift queue is fine for sure);

c) map control -  tap '~' to indicate that you're looking on the minimap;
and 
d) resources / limit check - tap 'Alt' when you're looking on top-right corner.

------------------
Tips

- You can bind 'ctrl-alt-m' to mouse button so you just need to press this button to start / pause tool and 'shift' plus mouse button to stop
